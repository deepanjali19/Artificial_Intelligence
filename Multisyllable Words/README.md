This program teaches children how to pronounce multisyllable words by dividing them into syllables. Limit your program to deal only with syllables of the following two sequences:

vowel–consonant–vowel: divide the word after the second vowel.

Example: analog ---> ana-log
 
vowel–consonant–consonant–vowel: divide the word between the two consonants.

Example: bumper ---> bum-per

Consider the following graph that has costs attached to its edges:

In this program, given two nodes X and Y in the graph above, will find the minimum-cost path from node X to node Y and display the found path and its cost. All data about the graph is declared in the program.

Example: the minimum path between a and d is [a,b,c,d] with cost = 6.
